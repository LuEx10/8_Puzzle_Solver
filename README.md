# 8-Puzzle Solver using A* Algorithm

This project is a solver for the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm.

## Project Description

The 8-puzzle problem consists of a 3x3 grid with numbers from 1 to 8 and a blank space represented by `0`. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to match the desired end configuration using a series of valid moves (up, down, left, right). The solver implemented in this project uses the A* algorithm to find the optimal sequence of moves from a given initial configuration to the solved state.
